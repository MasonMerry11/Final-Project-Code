Hello  my  name  is  Mason  Merry  and  I  am  a  first  year  computer  science  major. 
My  Final  Project  for  CIS 1051  is  a  game  called  Tower  Defense. 
Originally  I  had  the  idea  of making a 3d qbert dupe using unity as a software engine. 
But I felt that the task was too complicated and lengthy for a final project, so I switched
to a 2d Balloon Tower Defense dupe. I had a lot of fun making this project, it taught me what 
really all goes into building even the simplest looking games. I had to implement several files
that all worked hand in hand with each other to make the game run smoothly. Some difficulties
I faced throughout, were simple typo errors, as well as misplacing lines of codes in the wrong
spots. It took me no more than 10 minutes each to fix the problems once I ran the code and could
figure out what was wrong. I think this was definitely a good project to help me in the future, it
taught me a decent amount of things that we did not learn in class, it also helped me stregnthen my
file reading skills. I hope to make more games in the future.
